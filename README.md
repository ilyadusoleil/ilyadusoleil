<h2>Hi 👋, I'm Hamish</h2>
I'm a front end developer with a background in embedded software development for medical devices. While I love all things related to programming, I have a particular passion for interacting with all the stakeholders in projects I am working on to deliver the best possible outcome.

In my spare time I enjoy spending time in nature ⛰️🌲, making music 🎹🎺🎻, and have recently started particpating in triathlons 🏊‍♂️🚴🏃‍♂️.

- 🔭 I’m currently working all thing test kit related for [ZAVA](https://www.zavamed.com/uk/)
- 🌱 I’m always learning, and am back to working through the fantastic courses on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/)
