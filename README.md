<h2>Hi 👋, I'm Hamish</h2>
I'm a front end developer with a background in embedded software development for medical devices. While I love all things related to programming, I have a particular passion for interacting with all the stakeholders in projects I am working on to deliver the best possible outcome.

In my spare time I enjoy making music 🎺🎹🎻, rock climbing 🧗‍♂️ and long distance running 🏃‍♂️.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on educational software tools for [ZAVA](https://www.zavamed.com/uk/)
- 🌱 I’m always learning, currently working through [CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/)
